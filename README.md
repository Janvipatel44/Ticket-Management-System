Description:

This application contains four main roles – end users, admin, support staff, and managers.
End users will have the ability to log in and create tickets as per their requirements. They will have the ability to view the comments and update the case whenever necessary. Also, end-users will have the access to reopen a ticket in case of any issues provided they do it before 7 days after the ticket is marked as resolved.
The admin will have the ability to create users in the system with the help of a file containing necessary details and configurations. The admin can also retrieve important data from the system and store them at a different location as a backup.
The support staff plays a crucial role in this project where they can assign the unassigned tickets to themselves or to someone from the team. They can edit certain fields of a ticket along with adding comments to share the latest updates on the ticket.
Managers will have the ability to view the customer’s health, their team’s performance and will use the data to take management decisions.
The following are some of the significant features that are implemented in this project:
SLA functionality (both response and resolution).
Ability to export ticket details to a remote location.
